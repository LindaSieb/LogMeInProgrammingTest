Shopping List as a REST Service based on Java Spring Boot

This project was mostly created using a tutorial about employee payroll (and code from this project) using REST principles with Spring Boot and Maven.
The code was adapted to fit the needs of this project, and some debugging and learning was done through other sites.
Testing was done through Postman (https://www.postman.com/).
